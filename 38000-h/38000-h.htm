<h3><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h3>

<p>T<small>HE</small> main purpose which I have had in view
in writing this book has been to provide my
pupils with a <span class="smcap">SIMPLE</span> and <span class="smcap">ELEMENTARY</span> work on
Bridge. I have endeavoured to abstain from
assuming a knowledge of Whist or Whist
terms on the part of the reader, and have
merely attempted to write a text-book which
shall combine clear and concise statements of
my rules, with a reason for and explanation
of each one. These rules have stood the test
of practical experiment by myself and others
for the last five years, so that this statement
of them will, I trust, be of benefit both to
the beginner and to the advanced player.</p>

<p class="redhead">PLAYERS</p>

<p>Bridge is usually played by four persons.
If there are more than four candidates, the
prior right to play is decided by cutting the
cards.</p>

<p class="redhead">CUTTING</p>

<p>This is done from a full pack of fifty-two cards
which have been shuffled and spread face downward
on the table. Each player draws a card.
The four cutting the lowest cards play the first
rubber. In cutting ace is low. The cards are
also cut to decide partners, the two highest
playing against the two lowest. <i>The dealer is
the player cutting the lowest card of all</i>, and he
has the choice of the seats and of the cards.
Should the two players who cut the lowest
cards draw cards of equal value, they must cut
again to decide which shall deal.</p>

<p class="redhead">DEALING</p>

<p>Before being dealt, the cards must be shuffled
by the dealer and then cut by the player
at his right. It is customary to play with two
packs of cards, the dealer's partner shuffling,<a name="page_002" id="page_002"></a>
or making up, for his right-hand adversary.
The cards are dealt one at a time, from left
to right, until all are exhausted, each player
having thirteen cards. The last card should
not be turned face up. There is no penalty for
a misdeal.</p>

<p class="redhead">THE OBJECT OF THE GAME</p>

<p>There are two separate scores to be played
for&mdash;trick and honour scores. The trick score
is credited to the side that wins more than six
tricks; the honour score to the side that holds
the majority of the trump honours. The object
of the game is to score more points than your
adversaries, tricks and honours included. This
is best done by winning a rubber.</p>

<p class="redhead">THE GAME</p>

<p>The game consists of thirty or more trick
points. All points in excess of thirty are
counted by the side winning them; but only
one game can be won in a deal. Honours are
a separate score and do not count toward winning
the game.</p>

<p class="redhead">THE RUBBER</p>

<p>The rubber is the best of three games. If the
first two games are won by the same partners
the third is not played. One hundred points
are added to the total score of the side winning
the rubber.<a name="page_003" id="page_003"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">DECLARING THE TRUMP</p>

<p>The hand may be played either without a
trump, or a trump suit may be selected.</p>

<p>The dealer has the option of making a declaration
or of passing that privilege to his partner.
If the dealer passes the make, his partner
must announce the trump. A trump once made
cannot be changed at any time during the deal.</p>

<p class="redhead">TABLE OF TRICK VALUES</p>

<p class="redhead">DOUBLING</p>

<p>After the trump has been declared each adversary,
in turn, may increase the value of the
tricks by doubling.</p>

<p>The leader&mdash;the player at the left of the
dealer&mdash;has the first right to double. If the
leader does not wish to double his partner may
then do so.<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">REDOUBLING</p>

<p>If either the leader or his partner has doubled
the trump, the dealer or his partner may re-double,
the player who has made the trump
having the first right. This process may continue
indefinitely. Doubling or redoubling
does not affect the value of the honours.</p>

<p class="redhead">THE DUMMY</p>

<p>When the value of each trick has been determined,
and after a card has been led, the
dealer's partner places his hand face upward on
the table&mdash;the trump suit at his right&mdash;and the
dealer plays both hands. The dealer's partner&mdash;the
dummy&mdash;is not allowed to suggest, to
touch or to play a card except at the dealer's
bidding. It is the dummy's right, should the
dealer refuse to follow in any suit, to endeavour
to prevent a revoke. (See Conversation of the
Game.)</p>

<p class="redhead">THE PLAY</p>

<p>In the play of the cards the ace is high and
deuce low. You must follow suit, but if you
have no card of the suit led, you may either
trump or discard. At no-trump the best card
of the suit led wins the trick.</p>

<p class="redhead">THE CONVERSATION OF THE GAME</p>

<p>In order to avoid giving partner information
as to the character of one's hand, both the
<i>conversation</i> of the game and its order should<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a>
be strictly adhered to. To find that the wrong
person has announced the trump, or that a
player has doubled out of turn, or that one has
led without asking permission, is most irritating
to the other players, and a severe penalty
may often be exacted for such a mistake. The
dealer may either declare the trump or say, "I
pass." If the dealer passes, his partner must
announce the trump. The leader may either
double or say, "May I Lead, Partner?" this indicates
that he does not want to double, but
wishes to give his partner an opportunity to
do so. The leader's partner either says "No, I
double," or "lead, please."</p>

<p>The conversation is indicated in the following
diagram.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td align="center" valign="middle"
rowspan="5">

or<br />

</table>

<p><a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a></p>

<p>When the trump has been doubled the maker
says, "I redouble," or "I am satisfied." If
the maker is satisfied his partner says, "I redouble,"
or "I am satisfied." In many clubs
the conversation is somewhat changed and abbreviated.
"Pass." "Hearts." "I double."
"I go over." "I redouble" or "I go back."
"Enough," or a rap on the table to signify satisfaction.</p>

<p class="redhead">TO PREVENT A REVOKE</p>

<p>If your partner refuses to follow suit, always
ask, "Have you no (hearts), Partner?" An
error may then be rectified, but only before
the trick has been turned and quitted or before
another card has been led.</p>

<p class="redhead">SCORING</p>

<p>The score consists of two separate counts:
trick score and honour score. The trick score
is made by the side winning more than six
tricks in a hand. The honour score, by the
partners who hold the majority of the trump
honours. With a declared trump the honours
are A K Q J and 10. At no-trump only the
Aces count as honours. Doubling does not increase
the honour score.<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a></p>

<p>After the rubber has been won the honour
score and the trick score of each side are
added, and the leaser total deducted from the
greater.</p>

<p class="redhead">THE SCORE</p>

<p>There is no part of the game of Bridge to
which I would more urgently request the attention
of the player than to a careful consideration
of the state of the score. <i>It is useless
to attempt to play good Bridge without a knowledge
of the score.</i> If you blindly follow rules
for making, doubling, and playing, without
knowing exactly how many points you require
to win the game as well as the number needed
by your adversaries, you will needlessly lose
many rubbers.</p>

<p class="hang">Before you declare the trump look at the score to
determine the number of points you must
make in order to win the game.</p>

<p class="hang">Know the score when you contemplate doubling.</p>

<p class="hang">Never lead without knowing how many tricks
you must make in order to SAVE the game.</p>

<p class="hang">When you are the dealer outline your play to win
the game; and if you find it impossible to
win the game be sure to SAVE it.
<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">THE DECLARATION</p>

<p>While a few tricks may be dropped in the
play of a hand, an unsound make may result in
the loss of several hundred points. The importance,
both of making the trump to the score
and of considering the probability of securing
an honour score, cannot be too deeply impressed
on the player's mind. This, more than any
part of the game, requires the exercise of sound
judgment. The good maker has an enormous
advantage over the weak one.</p>

<p>Try to select the trump that will win the
greatest number of points with a strong hand,
and the one that will lose the fewest possible
number with a weak hand. Be liberal and
bold when behind in the game and conservative
and timid when ahead.</p>

<p>In suggesting rules for the make this difficulty
must be faced: the exercise of the best
judgment in the world will not enable one to
select the successful trump <span class="smcap">EVERY</span> time; and
players are apt to forget the many times a particular
make has won, and to be impressed by
the one time the rule failed them.</p>

<p class="hang">Follow consistently the laws for the make with
a certainty that in the large majority of
cases they will prove successful; and digress
from these laws only when the score warrants.

<p class="redhead">NO-TRUMP DECLARATION BY THE DEALER</p>

<p>Provided the hand contain no large honour
score in hearts or diamonds, it is evident that
the no-trump declaration is more likely than
any other to result in the gain of a large score;
the dealer should, therefore, first consider his
chances of winning at no-trump. There is a
large percentage in favour of the success of an
original no-trump make. The dealer can see
and combine his own with the dummy hand;
while his adversary makes the initial lead in
the dark. The dealer can play false cards;
while the adversaries cannot afford to deceive
each other. In short the dealer plays the hand
with an exact knowledge of the cards that are
held against him, and can take advantage of
any error made, or any information given by
the adversaries. As tricks are won by small
suit cards in every no-trump hand, there is no
method of estimating how many tricks your
hand may be worth. The dealer, in declaring
no-trump, may assume that his partner's hand
will contain an average amount of strength.
If the dealer is weak in one suit he is justified
in counting on his partner's hand for some
protection in that suit. The dealer should not
declare no-trump when he is reasonably sure
of winning the game or rubber with a trump
suit; neither should the dealer declare no-trump
without an ace in his hand&mdash;unless the<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a>
score is very desperate and then only when
his hand is exceptionally strong.</p>

<p>If the score warrants the dealer in taking a
chance at a weak make, it is safer to gamble at
no-trump than at a weak red declaration. At
no-trump the dealer's partner has a wider field
for assistance, as any one good suit will help.</p>

<p>On the rubber game, with the score very much
against him, the dealer should declare no-trump.</p>

<p class="redhead">HEARTS</p>

<p>In considering a heart make, the dealer
should be influenced by the general strength
of his hand and by the number of honours he
holds in the trump suit. Hearts should always
be declared with four or five honours in the
hand irrespective of the strength of other suits;
the honour score will probably more than compensate
for a possible loss of trick points. A
heart declaration with less than two honours
is not advisable&mdash;unless the hand contain
great length in the trump suit or great strength
in the other suits&mdash;as the honour scores made
against the hand will usually exceed its trick
value.</p>

<p class="redhead">HEARTS IN PREFERENCE TO NO-TRUMP</p>

<p>As it requires three odd tricks to win a game
of thirty points without a trump, and but one
trick more to win a game with a heart trump,
the dealer will often have occasion to choose
between the two makes. With a strong heart
hand and a doubtful "no-trumper," or if the
hand contain one unguarded suit, hearts should
always be given the preference. As the adversaries
have the lead and the privilege of doubling,
a weak suit exposes the hand to some
danger at no-trump.<a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">DIAMONDS</p>

<p>As there are two declarations of greater value
than diamonds, there is often a question as to
the advisability of passing the make with a fair
diamond hand and of giving partner an opportunity
to declare no-trump or hearts. The
dealer should always make the trump diamonds
holding four or five honours in his hand, irrespective
of the state of the score; holding less
than four honours the dealer must be influenced
by the number of points that are necessary
to win the game, and by the strength
of his hand. Many players are prejudiced
against an original diamond declaration when
the score is love all; and, while the writer believes<a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a>
it safer at this score to declare diamonds
with a fair hand than to chance the uncertainty
of a passed make, yet the make <span class="smcap">SHOULD</span>
be passed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang">When behind on the first game&mdash;as 0-24.</p>

<p class="hang">Having lost the first and with nothing scored on
the second game.</p>

<p class="hang">When nothing on the rubber game.</p>

<p>In each of these positions, as the adversaries
have the next deal and may win the game, it is
imperative that you score thirty points. To
accomplish this with a diamond trump it is
necessary to win eleven of the thirteen tricks;
therefore, unless you hold a hand of more than
the average strength, it is advisable to pass
the make in hopes that partner can declare
hearts or no-trump.</p>

<p>If there is a question between a diamond
and no-trump declaration, the latter is usually
preferable; for while the risk is greater the
reward is double.</p>

<p>A diamond make is advisable whenever there
is a fair chance to win the game, as when but
two or three odd tricks are needed.<a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">BLACK SUIT DECLARATIONS</p>

<p>The score should be the one excuse for an
original black declaration, and then only when
comparatively sure of winning the game. Otherwise,
when the hand does not admit of a red
or a no-trump declaration, the make should be
passed.</p>

<p class="redhead">CLUBS</p>

<p>Clubs should be made originally only when
the score is eighteen or more, and the hand
strong enough, with slight assistance, to win
the game. Clubs may be declared when there
are four honours in one hand, providing the
dealer has won the first game and is eight or
more on the second. The trick and honour
scores combined will count more than the
average make, and with great help the game
<i>may</i> be won.</p>

<p class="redhead">SPADES</p>

<p>Spades may be made originally when six
points or less are needed to win the game.<a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">DEFENSIVE SPADE MAKES</p>

<p>With a very weak hand some players advise
a defensive spade make with the object of preventing
partner's attempting a make which
may prove disastrous. While much may be
said in favour of an original black make under
these circumstances, it is doubtful whether it
pays; the adversaries are almost certain to
double, and you eliminate the possibility of securing
a large honour score and of winning the
game on that deal. The one time that a defensive
spade make might be justifiable is when
you are a game to the good and do not wish to
lose the advantage which this position offers.</p>

<p class="redhead">PASSED MAKES</p>

<p>The dummy hand, in declaring the trump,
should keep in mind the rules suggested for
the dealer, and, at the same time, be governed
in his choice by the state of the score, by the
general strength of his hand, and by the dealer's
acknowledged weakness. When the make
has been passed, one must infer that the dealer
has not a strong hand, neither has he much
strength in the red suits. While the latter inference
may be doubtful, the dealer often passing
a fair diamond hand, it is dangerous to
declare no-trump without protection in the red
suits, and the declaration may result in a disastrous
loss.</p>

<p>The following suggestions may prove useful:</p>

<p class="hang">The fact that your hand is exposed gives the adversaries
an opportunity to take advantage
of its weak points.<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a></p>

<p class="hang">A no-trump make that is weak in the red suits,
unless justified by the score, is unsound.</p>

<p class="hang">A no-trump make that is weak in Hearts is liable
to be doubled.</p>

<p class="hang">When a game ahead be conservative. When a
game behind be bold.</p>

<p class="hang">Endeavour to prevent the adversaries from winning
the first game on your deal. When the
adversaries have won a game and have the
first deal on the second, they hold an advantage
you will find most difficult to overcome.</p>

<p class="hang">If your hand is worth less than four tricks don't
make the trump red.</p>

<p class="hang">If your hand is worth less than four tricks make
the trump to lose as little as possible.</p>

<p class="redhead">DOUBLING</p>

<p>If you&mdash;being the leader or his partner&mdash;are
reasonably sure of the odd trick, it is decidedly
to your advantage to increase its value; but to
double "just for a gamble" rarely pays; it often
results in a redouble, and you are apt to find
the sport expensive and your partner very disagreeable.</p>

<p>In order to double with any degree of success,
you must consider the state of the score,
the possibility of a redouble, and your position
in regard to the maker. Above all things,
<span class="smcap">DEPEND ON YOUR OWN HAND</span> and don't expect
your partner to take <span class="smcap">MOST</span> of the tricks.</p>

<p>My advice to a beginner is: Be cautious and,
until you have learned to value your hand, be
satisfied with the number of points you can
make without doubling.</p>

<p class="redhead">ESTIMATING THE VALUE OF A HAND</p>

<p>To determine the probable trick-taking value
of your hand, count each Ace and King as a
trick, and add to these the number of tricks<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a>
you can take in the trump suit. Queens count
only as possible tricks, as the third round of a
suit may be trumped.</p>

<p>In determining the number of tricks you can
take in the trump suit you must remember that
it makes a great difference on which side of
you the trump strength lies. For instance,
holding Ace, Queen, and ten of trumps, if you
play after the maker, you will probably get
three tricks; but if the maker plays after you,
your trumps can be led through, and you may
make but one trump trick.</p>

<p class="redhead">RULES FOR DOUBLING</p>

<p class="hang">To double spades, you should hold in your hand
4 tricks and a possible 5th.</p>

<p class="hang">To double hearts, diamonds, or clubs, you should
hold five tricks and a possible 6th.</p>

<p class="hang">To double "no-trumps," you should hold 6 tricks
and a possible 7th.<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a></p>

<p>Be careful about doubling "no-trumps," unless
you hold a long established suit. Your
adversary may have seven tricks in <i>his</i> long
suit, and it is hard to discard from a "good all-round
hand."</p>

<p>Spades may be doubled when weak in
trumps; but, to double hearts, diamonds, or
clubs, you should have some trump strength.</p>

<p class="indbld">When doubling remember</p>

<p class="hang">That you show the dealer where the strength lies.</p>

<p class="hang">That you stand a better chance of winning the
odd trick by not exposing your strength.</p>

<p class="hang">That when the "maker" is on your right, you
have the advantage that your trumps are
over his.</p>

<p class="hang">That when the "maker" is on your left you are
at a disadvantage; his trumps are over
yours.</p>

<p class="hang">That it is a good time to double when the odd
trick wins the game for your adversaries,
and does not win it for you.</p>

<p class="hang">That it is a poor time to double when the odd
trick wins the game for you and does not
win it for your adversaries.</p>

<p class="hang">That with a doubtful hand it is better to be satisfied
with what you can make without doubling.</p>

<p class="hang">That if you double "no-trumps" your partner
will lead you his best heart.
<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">THE LEAD WHEN PARTNER HAS
DOUBLED</p>

<p>When your partner has doubled, the opening
lead must depend greatly on the scheme you
adopt for the play of your hand. It is a mistake
to suppose your partner wishes a trump
led EVERY time he doubles. On the contrary,
spades&mdash;when doubled&mdash;are seldom led by
good players, unless with a strong hand, until
they have gained information to justify the
trump lead.</p>

<p class="hang">The majority of hands will be covered by the
following rules:</p>

<p class="hang">If spades have been doubled and you hold four or
more trumps you should usually lead trumps.</p>

<p class="hang">It is fair to assume that your partner has
doubled with a good suit hand.
Lead trumps if you are weak in spades, but hold
a strong suit hand. Your partner has probably
doubled with trump strength.</p>

<p class="hang">If hearts, diamonds, or clubs have been doubled
and dummy is the "maker" it is usually
good play to lead trumps; that is, when you
have no short suit and so are unable to use
your trumps for ruffing.</p>

<p class="hang">If possible lead to take the first trick. After you
have seen the dummy you are in a position
to judge as to the advisability of the trump
lead.<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a></p>

<p class="hang">When hearts, diamonds, or clubs have been doubled
and the dealer is the maker, it is not
sound play to lead trumps. You would place
your partner in a bad position by leading up
to the dealer's declared strength.</p>

<p class="hang">When leading trumps always lead the top of two
or three and the lowest of four.</p>

<p class="redhead">HEART CONVENTION</p>

<p>When you have the first lead and your partner
has doubled a "no-trump" make you are
expected to lead your highest heart. As there
are very few hands where it is advisable to
double "no-trump" on general strength, it is
necessary for the leader to know what suit to
lead when his partner has doubled.</p>

<p>When the leader holds an A K or an A K Q
suit he should first lead the K of that suit and
then his highest heart.</p>

<p class="redhead">WEAK-SUIT CONVENTION</p>

<p>In England and in some parts of this country
the leader tries to guess his partner's suit by
leading the one in which he himself is weakest.
While this convention affords many more opportunities
of doubling, it is not nearly so safe
as the heart convention. There is about an
even chance that the weak suit led will put the
dealer or the dummy hand in the lead.<a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">THE NON-DEALER'S PLAY AGAINST A
DECLARED TRUMP</p>

<p>The principles of play adopted against a
trump and against a no-trump declaration are
entirely different; and it is for this reason that
Bridge is confusing to the beginner.</p>

<p>The important principles that govern the
play against a trump declaration are:</p>

<p class="hang">To hold the lead in order to see the dummy hand.</p>
<p class="hang">To make high cards before they can be trumped.</p>
<p class="hang">To give your partner information.</p>

<p>The importance of first seeing the thirteen
cards in the dummy is self-evident. The play
of an entire hand is often influenced by the
cards in the dummy; therefore, if you can win
the first trick, you are in a better position on
the second lead to play your own and your
partner's hand to advantage.</p>

<p>These combinations should be selected in
their order for the original lead without reference
to the length of the suit.</p>

<p>As the maker, more especially if the trump
is red, has shown strength, your first consideration<a name="page_028" id="page_028"></a>
should be to save the game. This is best
done by leading your Aces and other high
cards before the dealer has a chance to discard
and to trump. This is particularly true when
there is an established suit in the dummy
hand; for then the dealer may be able to exhaust
trumps and discard his own losing cards
on this established suit.</p>

your partner as much information as possible.
You certainly cannot expect to gain much by
deceiving the dealer&mdash;he knows what is held
against him&mdash;and it is a decided advantage for

and to understand what you are trying to do.

<p class="hang">If in any doubt as to your lead select your

<p class="redhead">WHY THE 4TH BEST CARD IS LED</p>

<p>There are two reasons for leading the 4th
best card of your long suit.</p>

<p class="hang">To show partner how many cards you hold in the
suit.</p>

<p class="hang">To show partner what you have in the suit.</p>

<p>If you lead 4th best and afterward either
discard or play a smaller one, your partner will
know that you originally held more than four
cards in that suit. The lead of a deuce, for instance,
shows but four cards in the suit. Your
partner, by applying the "Rule of Eleven," can
very often tell the exact combination of cards
from which you have led.</p>

<p class="redhead">THE RULE OF ELEVEN</p>

<p>Deduct the size of the card led from eleven,
and the difference will show how many cards
HIGHER than the one led are held outside the
leader's hand. If, for instance, your partner
lead an eight spot, the dummy having the
queen and you holding A 10 x of the suit, as
you see three cards above the eight, you know<a name="page_031" id="page_031"></a>
the dealer cannot play higher and that your
partner must have led from K J 9 8.</p>

<p>This rule is especially important at "no-trump";
but players should not give it much
attention unless the card originally led is
higher than a five.</p>

<p>If your partner has had the original lead,
and you have taken a trick, either make your
high cards or</p>

<p class="redhead">LEAD UP TO WEAKNESS</p>

<p>Weakness means no high cards, and leading
up to, is making a person play fourth in hand to
a trick. By leading a suit in which dummy
has weak cards, you may enable your partner
to win a trick cheaply. Whenever the dummy
hand is on your right you should take this advantage
of its weakness. It is sometimes good
play to lead a card higher than the dummy's
best. This, if the card you lead is not covered,
gives your partner a chance to pass the
trick.<a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">AFTER THE FIRST TRICK</p>

<p>After you have led and have won the first
trick, examine the exposed hand carefully;
then either continue with the suit led originally
or lead through strength.</p>

<p class="redhead">LEADING THROUGH STRENGTH</p>

<p>The beginner will appreciate the fact that
strength in a suit consists of high cards, but is
apt to find the term "leading through" difficult
to understand. Leading through means
to make a person play second in hand to the
trick. You always lead through your left-hand
adversary.</p>

<p>The object of leading through strength is to
help your partner make his high cards by giving
him the advantage of playing after the exposed
hand.</p>

<p class="hang">Holding a sequence of two or more cards, headed
by a Queen, Jack, or Ten, when there is an
honour in the dummy it is good play to lead
the highest card. If the dummy does not
cover this lead, it gives your partner an opportunity
to pass the trick.</p>

<p class="hang">Holding one or two high cards of dummy's strong
suit that are <i>not</i> in sequence, avoid leading
the suit. Wait until dummy leads to you.<a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">FORCING</p>

<p>Judicious forcing will do more than anything
else to break up a strong trump hand.</p>

<p>Forcing means making a player trump&mdash;the
object being to weaken his hand.</p>

<p>It is good play to force the strong trump
hand.<a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a></p>

<p class="hang">When the strong trump hand holds no more cards
of your long suit, do all damage possible with
it. Unless trumps are out, the suit is of no
other use to you.</p>

<p class="hang">It is bad play to force the weak trump hand.
Unless you can make the strong hand trump
it is better to stop leading the suit.</p>

<p class="hang">Do not lead a suit that will allow the weak hand
to trump and the other hand to discard; the
adversaries take the trick and get rid of a
losing card.</p>

<p class="hang">It is too late to force when the dummy has an
established suit and the dealer has the last
trump or trumps. Make what you can before
giving up the lead.</p>

<p class="hang">When the weak hand can ruff your suit, it is
sometimes good play to lead trumps; but
only when, in doing so, you are leading
trumps through the strong hand, and when
you have some protection in the other suits.</p>

<p class="redhead">SHORT SUITS</p>

<p>There are two lines of play that may be followed
to make tricks against the dealer. The
first&mdash;to make your high cards&mdash;has been explained.
The second is to make your small
trumps by ruffing.</p>

<p>When you have no high card lead, or if you
are anxious to be led up to, it is often good<a name="page_037" id="page_037"></a>
play to throw the lead and, at the same time,
to try to make your small trumps. This can be
done by leading a short suit.</p>

<p>A short suit is a suit of less than four cards;
but the term is commonly used to denote a
singleton or a two-card suit.</p>

<p>In order that your partner may understand
that you are leading a short suit (and not the
fourth best card of a long one) it is customary
to lead the highest card. (If you are forced
to open a suit with K J x, K x x or Q x x, the
low card should be led.)</p>

<p>To detect a short suit apply the "Rule of
Eleven." If there are (in your hand and the
dummy) more higher cards than the rule allows,
the lead cannot be the fourth-best card.</p>

<p>Under the following circumstances a short
suit should not be led.</p>

<p class="hang">If you hold four trumps, including any one honour,
don't lead a short suit. Your best play
is to open your long suit and force the dealer
to trump. In this way you weaken the
dealer's hand and you may prevent his
bringing in his long suit or you may even
establish and make your own.</p>

<p class="hang">If the make has been passed, don't lead a short
black suit. It is natural to suppose that the
dealer is strong in black suits&mdash;if in any&mdash;and
you would be leading up to declared
strength.<a name="page_038" id="page_038"></a></p>

<p class="hang">If you can take the first trick, do so and then
judge of the advisability of the short-suit
lead.</p>

<p class="redhead">THE DISCARD</p>

<p>There is considerable discussion and a wide
diversity of opinion among Bridge Players as
to the best suit to throw away. You should,
therefore, before playing, ask your partner
which method he adopts. Some advantage
may be claimed for each theory of discard; but
the main object of them all is the same&mdash;to indicate
to partner the suit you wish led and at
the same time protect any honours you may
hold in other suits.</p>

<p>The three different discards used by Bridge
Players are:</p>

<p class="hang">Strength, both with a trump and at "no-trump."</p>
<p class="hang">Strength, with a trump and weakness at "no-trump."</p>
<p class="hang">Weakness, both with a trump and at "no-trump."</p>

<p>The discard of strength with a trump and
weakness at "no-trump" is the one most commonly
used. This discard of weakness at "no-trump,"
while it has the advantage of saving
all the cards of the long suit, which you may
make, has also several disadvantages.</p>

<p class="hang">To show your suit absolutely you need two discards.<a name="page_039" id="page_039"></a></p>

<p class="hang">In order not to deceive your partner it may
be necessary to unguard honours, such as
J x x x, 10 x x x, Q x x, or even K x.</p>

<p class="hang">By discarding weakness you show the dealer
against which hand to finesse.</p>

<p>The writer, after the analysis of many thousand
hands, believes that at "no-trump" the
first discard from strength, <i>i.e.</i>, the long suit or
the suit you wish partner to lead, is the safest
and best, both for protecting the hand and for
showing the suit beyond possibility of mistake.</p>

<p>The main advantages of the strength discard
are:</p>

<p class="hang">It takes but one discard positively to show the
suit wanted.</p>

<p class="hang">You can protect the high cards in your weaker
suits without deceiving your partner.</p>

<p class="hang">It does not show the dealer so clearly on which
side to take a finesse.</p>

<p class="hang">By showing your suit earlier in the hand, you
enable your partner to discard to better advantage.</p>

<p>There are but few "no-trump" hands in
which it is possible to make all the small cards
of one's suit against the dealer&mdash;unless it be the
suit first opened. Occasionally the suit in
which the dealer is weak in both hands will be
made; but more often this suit is never brought<a name="page_040" id="page_040"></a>
in, because the adversaries do not know the
cards they hold in the two hands.</p>

<p>For years whist authorities have agreed that
with trump strength declared against you the
first discard should be from strength. Why,
then, when strength in all of the suits has been
declared, should not the strength discard be the
best defensive discard for the majority of bridge
hands? In order not to lose an opportunity
of making all of the long suit, players will continually
unguard cards in the weak suits which,
if properly protected, would win tricks; and
when using the weak suit discard these cards
<i>must</i> be unguarded in order to show partner
your suit.</p>

<p>There may be an occasional trick lost by discarding
from strength at "no-trump," but there
are so many tricks thrown away by unguarding
honours in weak suits, and so many games and
rubbers lost by guessing the wrong suit, that
Bridge Players will find the strength discard
will save more and lose less than any other
discard. You do not expect to win on your
adversaries' make; you hope to prevent their
winning a large score.</p>

<p>If you have once led, you have shown your
strength, and may then discard from any suit
you wish.</p>

<p>Discard only once from your strength, and
then as the situation and the hand warrant.<a name="page_041" id="page_041"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">THE REVERSE DISCARD</p>

<p>In discarding, the play of a high and then a
lower card reverses the original meaning of the
discard. If you adopt the strength discard,
and wish to throw away your weak suit at "no-trump,"
do so by discarding first a high and
then a lower card. If you use the weak discard
and wish to throw away your strong suit,
discard first a high and then a lower card.</p>

<p>The reverse discard should be used only
when it is clearly shown that two discards can
be made.</p>

<p class="redhead">HINTS ON DISCARDING</p>

<p class="hang">Watch the dealer's discards and protect the suit
that he is saving.</p>

<p class="hang">After you have led or shown your suit, the discard
of a high and then a lower card in another
suit shows command of the second suit.</p>

<p class="hang">The discard of an Ace shows great strength in
the suit.</p>

<p class="hang">If a spade declaration has been doubled by you
or your partner&mdash;and especially when either
of you has indicated strength by leading
trumps&mdash;the first discard should be from
weakness.</p>

<p class="hang">In discarding at "no-trump," don't throw away
all the cards of one suit: it exposes your
partner's hand, and makes it easy for the<a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a>
dealer to tell how that suit is placed. Besides,
you may need one card of that suit to
put your partner in the lead.</p>

<p class="hang">Save at least one card of your partner's long suit,
unless you are forced to give it up in order
to protect your hand.</p>

<p class="hang">After you have led or shown your suit your discard
should be from weakness.</p>

<p class="hang">If your partner is discarding from weakness, protect
the suit that he is throwing away, if
you can.</p>

<p class="hang">If forced to protect honours in other suits, don't
be afraid to unguard honours in the suit in
which partner is strong.</p>

<p class="redhead">NON-DEALER'S PLAY</p>

<p class="c"><span class="smcap">Second Hand</span></p>

<p>In determining the card to play second in
hand, you will find it a great assistance to ask
yourself why the dealer is leading that suit.
You can usually infer from the dummy's cards
and your own hand what the dealer must hold
to have led the suit.</p>

<p class="hang">Cover an honour with an honour. This should
always be done holding a perfect or an imperfect
fourchette (a card higher and a card
lower than the one led). An honour should
be covered when by so doing you hope to
make a card good in your partner's hand.<a name="page_043" id="page_043"></a>
Don't cover holding a K, Q, or J three times
guarded, unless your next best card is a nine
or better.</p>

<p class="hang">Don't hesitate. By hesitation a player often
shows the dealer how to play his cards.
Play quickly, and if there is any doubt as to
your play, play the lowest card you hold.</p>

<p class="hang">If the dummy has a tenace over your cards or
can take any card you hold, play low; let
the dealer do the guessing.</p>

<p class="hang">Holding any two or more honours in sequence,
play the lowest honour of the sequence.</p>

<p class="hang">Beat the dummy. When the dealer leads, it is
usually advisable to play a card higher than
the best in the dummy.</p>

<p class="hang">If you hold ace and others of the suit which the
dummy leads, and the trumps are all against
you, play your ace second in hand. If you
wait, your ace may be trumped.</p>

<p class="c"><span class="smcap">Third Hand</span></p>

<p>In this position your play should be guided
by a knowledge of the leads, an application of
the "Rule of Eleven," and a close observance
of the dummy hand.</p>

<p>Unless you hold two or more honours in sequence,
play your highest card. The object of doing<a name="page_044" id="page_044"></a>
this is either to win the trick, or, by forcing
a still higher card from your adversary, to
make a card good in your partner's hand.</p>

<p>Do not deceive your partner by playing an unnecessarily
high card. Holding any two
honours in sequence, play the lower.</p>

<p class="c"><span class="smcap">Finessing on Partner's Lead</span></p>

<p><b>When the dummy holds no honour, it is not
good play to "finesse against your partner."</b>
If you hold K J or A Q, by playing any card
but the best you not only give the dealer an
opportunity to make a trick, but you run the
risk of losing your own high cards in that suit.
If, however, the dummy holds an honour, K or
Q, and you hold A and J of the suit, you are
justified in finessing the J, hoping your partner
holds the missing honour. At "no-trump"&mdash;when
the dummy holds an honour&mdash;it is customary
to finesse much deeper, hoping to catch
the honour exposed on the table and so establish
partner's suit.</p>

<p class="redhead">THE ECHO</p>

<p>Some players use the echo only when they
can trump the third round of a suit.</p>

<p>The echo is a signal used by Bridge players
to show ability to win the third round of the
suit either with a trump or a high card.<a name="page_045" id="page_045"></a></p>

<p class="hang">If your partner leads the K and then the A when
you hold only two cards of that suit, show
you can trump the third round by playing
first the higher and then the lower.</p>

<p class="hang">If you hold the Q and your partner leads the K
and A, show in the same manner that you
can win the third round of the suit.</p>

<p class="hang">Don't echo with an honour; it may deceive your
partner.</p>

<p class="hang">At "no-trump" the echo is used to encourage
partner to continue that suit.</p>

<p class="hang">On a doubled spade, if your partner leads a high
trump, echo with three by playing the intermediate
trump to the first round.</p>

<p class="redhead">THE DEALER'S PLAY WITH A
DECLARED TRUMP</p>

<p>In playing the two hands, the dealer must
take advantage of any information he can gain
from the leads and plays of the adversaries;
and, in return, try to convey a false impression
of his own hand. Above all, the dealer should
know the score and estimate the number of
tricks he must take to win the game; always
bearing in mind that if he cannot win the
game, he should try to prevent the adversaries
from so doing.<a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">LEADING TRUMPS</p>

<p>One of the worst faults of the beginner is refusing
to lead trumps. When you hold seven
or more trumps in the two hands, usually lead
them. If you hold commanding suit cards,
the trump lead will prevent their being ruffed.
When you have no suit to make the lead will
establish your trump suit. If you hold high
cards that should be led up to, lead trumps to
throw the lead and to compel the adversaries
to lead to you.</p>

<p class="hang">Arrange to lead your trumps advantageously&mdash;from
the weak hand to the strong.</p>

<p class="hang">After trumps are exhausted, try to clearer establish
the longest suit in the two hands.</p>

<p class="hang">It is usually good play to draw two trumps for
one; but when the best trump is against you,
do not waste two of yours to get it out.</p>

<p class="hang">Lead the losing trump only when you have an
established suit and a sure re-entry.</p>

<p class="hang">When you hold one or more trumps and a losing
card, always lead the trumps. This will
force the adversaries to discard and they
may not save the right suit.</p>

<p class="hang">Aim to discard your losing cards from the one
hand, on the commanding cards in the other.</p>

<p class="hang">With a weak hand you are more likely to make
your high cards if you put your adversaries
in the lead.
<a name="page_047" id="page_047"></a></p>

<p class="c"><span class="smcap">Not Leading Trumps</span></p>

<p>The exception to the trump lead is when the
weaker of the two trump hands contains a
short suit and can ruff; then, before leading
trumps, allow the weak hand to trump your
losing cards.</p>

<p>Unless a cross ruff can be established, it is
usually bad play to weaken your strong trump
hand by forcing it to ruff. If you do this, you
will find it difficult to exhaust trumps from the
adversaries' hands and to make any commanding
suit cards you may hold.</p>

<p>If your adversary has doubled, be cautious
about leading trumps. It is good play to lead
through the doubling hand; but bad play to
lead up to it.</p>

<p class="redhead">THE NON-DEALER'S PLAY OF A "NO-TRUMP"
HAND</p>

<p>With a declared trump you aim to make your
high cards; but at no-trump the high cards
take care of themselves and you must try to
establish your small cards.</p>

<p>If you are the leader at "no-trump," open
your longest suit. Save the high cards of
your other suits for re-entry and try to establish
the small cards of your long suit.</p>

<p class="hang">Don't lead your aces and kings to take a look at
dummy; later in the hand you will need
them to get the lead and bring in your established
suit.
<a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a>
The majority of "no-trump" makes are
strong in three suits. Your long suits may be
the weak spot in the dealer's hand.</p>

<p>Try to infer, from the dummy hand and your
own, the high cards the dealer must hold to
have declared "no-trump." You will be surprised
to find how many times an inference
thus drawn will enable you to play your hand
to advantage.</p>

<p>Having started your long suit, usually the
best play is to continue that suit until it becomes
established, especially if you hold one
or two re-entry cards.</p>

<p>Don't change suits unless your suit is hopelessly
against you. When it requires two leads
to clear your suit, and you hold no cards of re-entry,
abandon it and play for your partner's
suit&mdash;the suit that he has shown by his discard,
or the suit which must be his, judging
from your own and the dummy hand.</p>

<p>In leading to your partner's declared suit,
always lead your highest card; this will enable
him to tell what high cards are held against
his suit and it will prevent your blocking his
hand.</p>

<p class="redhead">RETURN YOUR PARTNER'S LEAD</p>

<p>If your partner has had the original lead, <small>RETURN
HIS SUIT</small>. There are very few "no-trump"
hands where it is possible to bring in more<a name="page_049" id="page_049"></a>
than one suit, and if, instead of returning your
partner's suit, you lead your own, you are playing
for one suit and your partner for another, and
as a result you will probably establish neither.</p>

<p>When it is evident that your suit is stronger
than your partner's&mdash;i.e., if you have re-entry
cards and can establish the suit in one lead&mdash;then,
by all means, play for your own suit;
but don't be deterred from returning your
partner's lead simply because you see that the
best card of his suit is against him. That card
will have to make anyway, and by forcing it
out of dummy at once you may enable partner
to make the rest of his suit.</p>

<p><b>In returning your partner's lead, return your
highest card.</b> The importance of this is apparent:
your partner can see the cards in his own
and in the dummy hand, and if you return your
best card he also knows what the dealer holds
in that suit. It may prevent his leading up to
the dealer's tenace; it may show him that the
suit should be abandoned or that it should be
again led from your hand. Returning the
highest card minimises the risk of blocking
the suit. Very often, by not getting rid of a 7,
8, 9, or 10 early in the hand, you make it impossible
for your partner to make his small
cards.</p>

<p><b>Don't be deceived by the dealer's play.</b> His
object is to fool you; and if he holds cards of
equal value, he will probably take the trick
with the highest.<a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a></p>

<p><b>Notice carefully your partner's first discard.</b>
It shows you the suit to lead and may also
affect your own discard.</p>

<p>Don't, because the dealer leads the suit, refuse
to take tricks with your aces and kings.
By taking the trick, you may make a card
good in your partner's hand. It is only the
dealer who is in a position to know when to refuse
tricks; he sees the two hands.</p>

<p>When there is no chance that your partner
can take a trick in the suit led, it is sometimes
wise to keep the commanding card until one
hand cannot put the other in the lead, especially
when there is no re-entry card in the
hand with the long suit.</p>

<p class="redhead">OPENING LEAD AT "NO-TRUMP"</p>

<p>Unless your partner has doubled (see Heart
and Weak Suit Conventions) lead from your
longest suit. It is not advisable, especially
when you hold no cards of re-entry, to lead aces
and kings, except when you hope to catch all
of the smaller cards. Two rounds may exhaust
the suit in your partner's hand; and if you
have no re-entry card and he has none of your
suit to lead you, your long suit, even though
established, is absolutely worthless.</p>

<p class="hang">The lead of an ace, king, or queen indicates great
strength, either seven cards or three honours.<a name="page_051" id="page_051"></a></p>

<p class="hang">Holding two suits of equal length and strength,
lead a red suit in preference to a black, especially
if the make has been passed,</p>

<p class="hang">Holding two suits of equal length, keep for re-entry
the suit with the higher cards, as,</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary=""

<tr><td colspan="3">and establish it, the ace is a sure re-entry<br />
card; if you open the ace suit the queen is a<br />
very doubtful card of re-entry.</td></tr>

</table>
<p>With a weak long suit and no re-entry card,
many good bridge players open the highest
card of a short suit, preferably hearts or diamonds.
The theory is that, had the dealer
been strong in the red suits, he would have
declared a red trump; and with a worthless
hand, this short suit lead may assist partner.
While there is much to be said in favour of this
play, I would suggest that, unless your partner
thoroughly understands the game and your
play, it is safer to open your long suit.</p>

<p>When you are opening a long, weak suit
from a hand without re-entry cards it is advisable
that you convey this information to your
partner. This you can do by leading the top
or an intermediate card of your long suit; your
partner, by applying the "Rule of Eleven,"
can see that you are not leading the fourth
best card, and unless it is for the best interest<a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a>
of the two hands will not return the suit. For
example:</p>

<p class="redhead">THE DEALER'S PLAY OF A NO-TRUMP HAND</p>

<p>The dealer's play of a "no-trump" hand is
both the most interesting and the most intricate
part of Bridge. Very often a single error<a name="page_054" id="page_054"></a>
will result in the loss of three or more tricks;
so that it behooves the dealer&mdash;as he has no
assistance from his partner&mdash;to make himself
thoroughly conversant with the strategy of the
game.</p>

<p>The following rules cover all the important
points in the dealer's play.</p>

<p class="hang">Keep the commanding card of your adversary's
suit.</p>

<p>This the beginner invariably refuses to do; he
is too anxious to take a trick and does not realise
that he will often gain several by passing.</p>

<p>Before playing the commanding card of your
adversaries' suit, wait&mdash;if you can&mdash;until the
leader's partner has played his last card of
that suit; he is then unable to return the lead,
and there may be no card of re-entry in his
partner's hand.</p>

<p class="hang">Rarely refuse to take tricks with your Kings and
Queens.</p>

<p class="hang">When an entire suit is against you, it pays to
take the lead; the adversaries may change
the suit.</p>

<p class="hang">When you see in your hands enough tricks to
win the game, always take the lead.</p>

<p class="hang">Always take the lead when doing so makes a
card good in either of your hands.<a name="page_055" id="page_055"></a></p>

<p class="hang">Play for the longest suit in the two hands.</p>

<p>After taking the lead, count the cards of each
suit in the combined hands and make it your
object to play for the longest. It may sometimes
be necessary, in order to lead the suit to
the best advantage, to wait until it can be led
from the other hand.</p>

<p class="hang">With two suits of equal length, play for the one
in the hand that has cards of re-entry.</p>

<p class="hang">With two suits of equal length, play for the one
that is shown on the table. Don't give your
opponents unnecessary information of your
strength.</p>

<p class="hang">With two suits of equal length, play for the one
which, when established, will give you the
greater number of tricks, as<br />

7 cards in one hand and 1 in the other.<br />
6 cards in one hand and 2 in the other.<br />
5 cards in one hand and 3 in the other.<br />
4 cards in one hand and 4 in the other.<br />
</p>

<p class="hang">Holding only seven cards of a suit, you will often
find an adversary with four cards of that
suit.</p>

<p class="hang">Holding only six cards of a suit, remember that
your adversaries have seven and that leading
the suit will establish it against you.</p>

<p class="hang">When the best card of your suit is against you,
lead to get it out of your way. It pays to
establish one suit.
<a name="page_056" id="page_056"></a>
The beginner will usually play his high
cards, and, after establishing one or two tricks
in that suit for his adversaries, proceed to do
the same with another suit and end by abusing
his partner for making it "no-trump" with so
weak a hand.</p>

<p class="hang">Lead from the weak hand to the strong.</p>

<p>This is the secret of playing the two hands
well. Play for the longest suit in the two
hands; but arrange the lead so that it comes
from the hand that has no high cards.</p>

<p class="hang">Holding a combination of Ace, Queen, Jack in the
two hands, try to catch the King by leading
the highest card from the one hand up to the
Ace in the other.</p>

<p>This is really a continuation of the last rule,
but its importance demands a separate heading.
The correct play of this combination will
win more tricks than any one other play in
Bridge.</p>

<p>If the King is guarded, and you lead the Ace
or from the Ace, the King <i>must</i> win; but if
you lead from the other hand, there is an even<a name="page_057" id="page_057"></a>
chance that you will find the King on the side
you wish. If it is in the other hand, it would
probably make anyhow.</p>

<p class="hang">Avoid blocking your suit, by leading or playing
the high cards from the shorter of the
two hands.</p>

<p>As with A K x in one hand and Q x x x x x
in the other, play A K x.</p>

<p>As with A Q x in one hand and K x x x x x
in the other, play A Q x.</p>

<p class="hang">Keep a re-entry card in the hand that has the
long suit.</p>

<p>If you are able to take the trick in either
hand, do not take it with the hand that has the
long suit, unless that suit is established. If
you cannot place the lead in the hand with the
long suit, it is useless to establish that suit. It
is often advisable to refuse to part with the
highest card of a long suit, if that card is the
only re-entry for the suit.</p>

<p class="redhead">FINESSING</p>

<p>At "no-trump" the dealer has many opportunities
to win tricks with cards that are not
the best. In attempting this he should be
guided by the following principles.</p>

<p class="hang">It is better to finesse on the second round of the
suit than on the first.</p>

<p class="hang">By forcing discards, you can often tell which adversary
is holding and protecting an honour<a name="page_058" id="page_058"></a>
in the suit in question, and on which side
the finesse should be taken.</p>

<p class="hang">When there is a question on which side to take
the finesse, be careful to shut out the hand
with the established suit.</p>

<p class="hang">Do not finesse with nine cards of a suit in the
two hands, including both the Ace and King.
As there are but four more cards of the suit,
the Queen will probably fall on one of the
two leads.</p>

<p class="hang">Holding ten cards of one suit, including the Ace,
Queen, Jack combination, lead the Queen
toward the Ace; but if the Queen is not
covered by the King, play the Ace on it.</p>

<p class="redhead">"BRIDGE DON'TS"</p>

<p>Don't form the habit of playing slowly.</p>

<p>Don't expect your partner to play well when
you criticise him. A little encouragement will
win you rubbers and will add to your popularity.</p>

<p>Don't forget that it requires more skill to
play a poor hand than it does to play a good
one.</p>

<p>Don't miss an opportunity to win the game
or to save it.</p>

<p>Don't complain if you hold poor cards and
don't exult over good ones.</p>

<p>Don't criticise at all; but, if you must, wait
until the hand is finished.<a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a></p>

<p>Don't hurry when exacting a penalty.</p>

<p>Don't think entirely of your own hand.</p>

<p>Don't take advantage of your partner's
breach of etiquette.</p>

<p>Don't think that bad play won't sometimes
win tricks.</p>

<p>Don't forget the score for an instant.</p>

<p>Don't ignore the value of small cards.</p>

<p>Don't fail to see your partner's first discard.</p>

<p>Don't be deceived by the dealer's play.</p>

<p class="redhead">RULES</p>

<p>It is impossible to suggest rules that will
cover the play of every hand. Rules are formulated
after the analysis of a great many hands,
and are therefore made to meet the <i>usual</i> distribution
of the cards. When the fall of the
cards reveals an unusual situation, unusual
means must be adopted to meet it; and here
your reason and common sense must come
to your aid.</p>

<p>The best Bridge players have the greatest
regard for the rules; but the strong player
recognises a situation for which a rule is not
provided, and he allows his reason to dictate to
him the times to follow and the times to violate
them.</p>

<p class="redhead">MANNERISMS</p>

<p>There is nobody who cares to be told that he
plays cards unfairly; but, if you permit your<a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a>
manner to give your partner or the opponents
the slightest intimation of the cards you hold,
you lay yourself open to such criticism. Cards
do not carry with them a license to be unfair or
rude, yet, at the Bridge table, many socially
correct people are both.</p>

<p>Try always to pause the same length of time
before making the trump or passing. Do not
allow your manner to express approval or disapproval
of your partner's make or of the cards
he plays, and select each of your own cards
with equal deliberation. When you hold good
cards be content to win tricks with them, without
manifesting glee at your adversaries' defeat.
When your cards are poor, do not complain
of them; you imply that the opponents
profit by your weak hands and not by their
own skill, and, as a rule, the more you rail
at your luck the worse it becomes. Be generous
with your praise of a well-played hand, and
be sure your partner will play a better game if
he does not fear your adverse criticism. Do
not permit yourself to take advantage of, or be
deceived by, any mannerisms of your partner
or of the opponents, and let your own manner
be uniformly such that nobody can tell from
it whether you are winning or losing.</p>

<p class="redhead">MEMORY</p>

<p>It is not necessary to have a fine memory in
order to play Bridge well; but it <i>does</i> require<a name="page_061" id="page_061"></a>
the ability to count thirteen. If you know
<i>how many</i> cards of a suit have been played,
you soon will be able to tell <i>what</i> cards have
been played.</p>

<p>Begin with one suit, preferably your own,
and count each card of that suit as it is played;
you will be surprised to find that you will soon
notice not only where the cards of that suit
are, but just what cards have been played. A
little practice will enable you to do the same
with all of the suits.</p>

<p>No matter what may be your position at the
table, you may cultivate your memory by observing
carefully the cards laid down by the
dummy. The number of cards remaining in a
suit at any stage of the play will assist you in
recalling how many rounds of that suit have
been played, and this will help you in recollecting
what high cards were played in those
rounds.</p>

<p>When you are dummy, and have nothing to
do with the play, occupy your time and attention
with a determined effort to remember
each card played by your partner, the dealer.
At the end of the hand see if you can recall
how many of each suit he held. With a little
practice you will be able to recall what his
high cards were as well as the number in each
suit. Memory is simply a matter of observation
and practice.<a name="page_062" id="page_062"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">INFERENCES</p>

<p>The play of each card conveys some information;
and the secret of playing Bridge well
lies in being able to draw inferences rapidly
and correctly and in utilising the knowledge
thus gained. If you simply look, in a mechanical
way, at the cards as they fall without inferring
what was meant by the play, you are
apt to find yourself in the lead and at a complete
loss as to what to do next.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Following are Suggestions for Inferences
to be Drawn by the Dealer.</span></p>

<p class="hang">What will the make probably be if you pass?</p>
<p class="mrg">Your partner is apt to make it the suit in
which you are weakest.</p>

<p class="hang">Does the opening lead show a long or a short suit?</p>
<p class="mrg">
If short, be on the alert to get the lead and
exhaust trumps. If long, how many cards
does the leader hold, and what high cards
does his lead show?</p>

<p class="hang">Ask yourself why does the adversary discard one
suit and save another?</p>
<p class="mrg">This will aid in
locating honours and in making successful
finesses.</p>

<p>If the left-hand adversary leads through the
Ace Queen suit in dummy, he probably does
not hold the King and is tempting you to
finesse. If he refuses to lead through the Ace
Queen suit he is very likely waiting for you to
up to his King.<a name="page_063" id="page_063"></a></p>

<p>If the make has been doubled try to infer
what trump honours are in the doubling hand;
this will enable you to judge as to the advisability
of the trump lead.</p>

<p class="redhead">SUGGESTIONS FOR THE NON-DEALER</p>

<p class="hang">From what combination of cards is your partner
leading? Remember the high cards that he
holds.</p>

<p class="hang">The lead of a King, for instance, shows you that
partner has the Ace, the Queen, or both.</p>

<p class="hang">The lead of a Jack indicates the top of a suit.</p>

<p class="hang">The lead of a seven, eight, or nine probably means
the highest card of a short suit.</p>

<p class="hang">Don't draw rigid inferences from the dealer's
play; he will endeavour to deceive you by
playing false cards.</p>

<p class="hang">If it is an original make, your own and the dummy
hand will help you to infer what trumps
or high cards the dealer holds.</p>

<p class="hang">If the dealer seems backward in leading trump
he is probably aiming to ruff with the weak
hand and a trump lead from you may prevent
this.</p>

<p class="hang">Endeavour to understand your partner's discards.
You can then protect the suit in which he is
weak, and, if necessary, unguard honours
in the suit in which he has shown strength.<a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a></p>

<p class="hang">When partner returns your lead in No-trump,
notice carefully the card that he plays. It
will help you to place the suit and prevent
your leading to a possible tenace in the dealer's
hand.</p>

<p class="redhead">COMBINING THE HANDS OF DEALER
AND DUMMY</p>

<p>The following table gives the different combinations
of cards and shows how they should
be played to get the best results when the
dealer holds one combination and the dummy

card than any in the hand to which you

all these combinations, depending on whether
you or your adversaries open the suit. Try
to get the adversaries to open such suits for<a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a>

lead in the dummy hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 1.</span>&mdash;A opens his fourth best heart, as
his hand is strong, and he wishes his partner
to return that suit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Dealer.</span>&mdash;As the longest suit in the two
hands is diamonds, the dealer takes the first
trick with the A of hearts, so that he may be
able, if necessary, to put the dummy hand in
the lead; also so that the adversaries may not
know the cards he holds in the heart suit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 2.</span>&mdash;A refuses to part with the commanding
card of the diamond suit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 3.</span>&mdash;The dealer takes the lead in the
dummy hand in order to establish his diamond
suit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 4.</span>&mdash;As the dealer has now no diamonds,
it is useless to hold up any longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 6.</span>&mdash;If A leads either clubs or spades
he must lose a trick; his best play is to continue
with the heart suit.<a name="page_077" id="page_077"></a></p>

fourth best card.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 2.</span>&mdash;B returns his partner's lead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 3.</span>&mdash;A continues with his suit in order
to establish it, as he holds the K of diamonds
and the Q of clubs for re-entry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 4.</span>&mdash;The dealer has the choice of three
suits, the spades, clubs, and diamonds being of
equal length. If he leads a spade he takes
away the re-entry card for the dummy's club
suit. If he takes the lead in the dummy and
attempts to catch the K of diamonds by leading
the Q up to the A, he gives A an opportunity
of making his two hearts and of saving the
game. In order to win three by-cards and the
game, he must prevent A from getting the lead;
he therefore leads the club and allows B to win
the trick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 5.</span>&mdash;The dealer must play the A of diamonds;
for if the clubs fall evenly the rest of
the tricks are his.<a name="page_081" id="page_081"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 1.</span>&mdash;The scheme which the dealer must
adopt for the play of the two hands is to exhaust
trumps and to establish the club suit.
Holding the A, Q, and J of diamonds, in order
to catch the K, the lead must come from the
dummy; and so that he may lead up to his
tenace in trumps, the dealer trumps the Q of
hearts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 2.</span>&mdash;As the finesse succeeds the dealer
must place the lead in dummy so that he may
again lead through the K of diamonds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 3.</span>&mdash;The dealer holds too many clubs,
so must use the A of spades to get the lead
in dummy, even though it clears the spade suit
for the adversaries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tricks 4 and 5.</span>&mdash;The trumps fall evenly, leaving
the dealer with the last trump.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 6.</span>&mdash;The K of clubs, being guarded,
must make.<a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 1.</span>&mdash;The correct second in hand play
of this combination is the queen, hoping to win
two tricks in the suit. Z, in order to win three
by-cards and the rubber, must take a finesse in
spades; and so not only refuses to play the
queen second in hand, but will not take the
trick fourth in hand. His object is to wait
until B's last heart has been played.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 2.</span>&mdash;If B starts the diamond suit, the
dealer cannot make more than the odd trick;
but the situation looks as if A holds both ace
and king of hearts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 3.</span>&mdash;A, having a possible re-entry card,
must establish his suit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 4.</span>&mdash;Z leads the club suit in order to
force discards, and arranges the lead so that
his tenace in spades may be led up to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 9.</span>&mdash;Z cannot afford to let A get the
lead.<a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a></p>

queen of diamonds, Z passes the first trick,
hoping to win with his ten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 2.</span>&mdash;Many players would lead the club
suit because of dummy's weakness; but in the
original play of this hand B led the queen of
hearts.</p>

the queen is guarded in A's hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 4.</span>&mdash;In order to prevent the queen of
spades from winning, Z must get the lead in
his own hand. If he takes the finesse in clubs
and it loses, the adversaries must make the entire
heart suit. The finesse can win only <i>one</i>
trick, and it might lose five or six tricks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 1.</span>&mdash;A leads from his long suit, and Z
wins the trick with the singleton ace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 2.</span>&mdash;The dealer, having eight clubs and
eight spades in the two hands, has now a choice
of suits. The king of spades <i>must</i> make against
him while he has a finesse in the club suit. If
he leads the clubs first he is compelled to guess
in which hand to take the finesse; he therefore
leads the spade, hoping by establishing that
suit to force discards and find out where the
two queens are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trick 3.</span>&mdash;B might make it more difficult for
A by not playing the king of spades.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tricks 5, 6, 7, and 8.</span>&mdash;A's two discards of
clubs show that the queen is not in his hand,
while B's heart discard indicates that he does
not hold the queen of hearts. The queen of
hearts is also marked in A's hand by the fact
that he is discarding his winning diamonds
and protecting hearts.<a name="page_093" id="page_093"></a></p>

<p class="c">The dealer loses three by-cards and the rubber.<a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">BRIDGE FOR THREE PLAYERS</p>

<p>When the game is played by three persons
the cards are cut to decide which shall have the
dummy; the one cutting the lowest card has
the deal and a permanent dummy during the
game or the rubber, as the case may be. It is
then customary for each player to have dummy
in turn, during one game or rubber.</p>

<p>In playing rubbers, 100 points are added to
the score of the winning side.</p>

<p>In playing games, 50 points are added to
score of the winning side.</p>

<p>If the make is passed to dummy, four aces
or three aces constitute a compulsory "no-trump"
declaration; otherwise, dummy must
declare the longest suit.</p>

<p>When there are two suits of equal length,
dummy must select the suit which counts most
by spots, the ace counting eleven and the other
honours ten each. If the suits are still equal,
dummy declares the one having the higher
trick valuation.</p>

<p>Only one adversary, the leader, can double.</p>

<p>If the dealer has seen the two hands, he is
not allowed to re-double.</p>

<p>The dummy hand is not exposed until the
doubling has been settled and a card led.</p>

<p>When the dummy is the leader, his partner
must look at dummy hand and lead from it before<a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a>
seeing his own cards; and dummy alone
has the right to double.</p>

<p class="redhead">DUPLICATE BRIDGE</p>

<p>Bridge, when first introduced, was played
almost entirely for a stake; but, in the last few
years, many players have taken up the game&mdash;<i>per
se</i>&mdash;on account of its interesting possibilities
and the intellectual pleasure it gives. Duplicate
and Progressive Bridge have, therefore,
become very popular.</p>

<p>The object of Duplicate Bridge is to eliminate,
as nearly as is possible, the element of
luck, and to make the game not so much a
question of holding good cards as a comparative
test of skill between players. A perfect
test cannot be made by a single trial, as an
unusual distribution of the cards might defeat
two strong players, but in a series of
duplicate games, good makes and good plays
will undoubtedly mark the better Bridge
players.</p>

<p>As Duplicate Bridge is played for points,
not games or rubbers, the honour score requires
as much attention as the trick score.</p>

<p>Remember that holding three red honours
you can stand the loss of two odd tricks (unless
the mate is doubled) without losing on
the deal, and that there is almost an even<a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a>
chance that your partner will hold another
honour.</p>

<p>It you make it red with but one honour, your
adversaries will probably secure the honour
score.</p>

<p>If you declare "no-trump" with but one ace
the honours will probably be even; but you
may find three aces against you.</p>

<p>Remember that four honours in clubs count
as much as the average deal is worth.</p>

<p class="redhead">PROGRESSIVE BRIDGE</p>

<p>Progressive Bridge may be played in much
the same manner as Progressive Euchre. While
to win at this game is very largely a matter
of holding good cards, it forms an interesting
social amusement; and, to players who
are unaccustomed to the arrangement of the
cards in Duplicate Bridge, is much less confusing.</p>

<p>In Progressive Bridge the players are usually
numbered, 1, 2, 3, 4 playing at Table 1, and
5, 6, 7, 8 at Table 2, etc.</p>

<p>At each table the cards are cut in the usual
manner for partners and for the deal; and a
stated number of hands played for points, tricks
and honours included, without regard to games
or rubbers.</p>

<p>After playing the number of deals decided<a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a>
upon, the winning pair move to the next table,
where the cards are again cut for partners, and
for the deal.</p>

<p>An individual score is kept of the points lost
and won during the entire game; the points
lost being deducted from those won, and the
player making the best net score being declared
the winner.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_LAWS_OF_BRIDGE" id="THE_LAWS_OF_BRIDGE"></a>THE LAWS OF BRIDGE<br /><br />
<small>REVISED, 1905</small></h3>

<p><i>The laws of Bridge published in this edition have been
prepared by the author, who has used as a foundation the
codes accepted by the principal clubs of the world. The
author does not favour the exaction of a penalty for the
dealer's lead out of turn. The American opinion on this
point is divided, but the English practice is to exact no penalty.
Otherwise the various club codes show but minor differences.</i></p>

<p class="redhead">THE RUBBER</p>

<p>1. The partners first winning two games
win the rubber. If the first two games be won
by the same partners, the third game is not
played.</p>

<p class="redhead">SCORING</p>

<p>2. A game consists of thirty points obtained
by tricks alone, exclusive of any points counted
for honours, chicane or slam.</p>

<p>3. Every hand is played out, and any points
in excess of thirty points necessary for the
game are counted.</p>

<p>4. Each trick above six counts two points
when spades are trumps, four points when clubs<a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>
are trumps, six points when diamonds are
trumps, eight points when hearts are trumps,
and twelve points when there are no trumps.</p>

<p>5. Honours are ace, king, queen, knave and
ten of the trump suit; or the aces when no
trump is declared.</p>

<p>6. Honours are credited to the original holders
and are valued as follows:</p>

<p>7. If a player and his partner make thirteen
tricks, independently of any tricks gained by the
revoke penalty, they score Grand Slam and add
forty points to their honour count.</p>

<p>8. Little slam is twelve tricks similarly
scored, and adds twenty points to the honour
count.</p>

<p>9. Chicane (one hand void of trumps) is<a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a>
equal in value to three honours, <i>i.e.</i>, if partner
of player having chicane scores honours he adds
the value of three honours to his honour score,
while, if the adversaries score honours, it deducts
an equal value from their honour score.
Double Chicane (a player and his partner both
void of trumps) is equal in value to four honours,
and the value thereof may be deducted
from the total honour score of the adversaries.</p>

<p>10. The value of honours, slam, little slam,
or chicane, is in nowise affected by doubling or
redoubling.</p>

<p>11. At the conclusion of a rubber the scores
for tricks, honours, Chicane, and Slam, obtained
by each side are added, and one hundred
points are added to the score of the winners of
the rubber. The difference between the completed
scores is the number of points won or
lost by the winners of the rubber.</p>

<p>12. If an erroneous score affecting tricks be
proven, such mistake must be corrected prior to
the conclusion of the game in which it has occurred,
and such game shall not be considered
as concluded until the following deal has been
completed and the trump declared, unless it be
that the game is the last one of the rubber,&mdash;then
the score is subject to inquiry until an<a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a>
agreement between the sides (as to the value of
the rubber) shall have been reached.</p>

<p>13. If an erroneous score affecting honours,
chicane or slam be proven, such mistake may
be corrected at any time before the score of the
rubber has been made up and agreed upon.</p>

<p class="redhead">CUTTING</p>

<p>14. The ace is the lowest card.</p>

<p>15. In all cases every player must cut from
the same pack.</p>

<p>16. Should a player expose more than one
card, he must cut again.</p>

<p class="redhead">FORMING TABLES</p>

<p>17. The prior right of playing is with those
first in the room. If there are more than four
candidates for seats at a table, the privilege of
playing is decided by cutting. The four who
cut the lowest cards play first.</p>

<p>18. After the table is formed, the players
cut to decide on partners; the two lowest play
against the two highest. The lowest is the
dealer, who has choice of cards and seats, and
who, having once made his selection, must abide
by it.<a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a></p>

<p>19. Should the two players who cut lowest,
secure cards of equal value, they shall re-cut to
determine which of the two shall deal, and the
lower on the re-cut deals.</p>

<p>20. Should three players cut cards of equal
value, they cut again; if the fourth card be the
highest, the two lowest of the new cut are partners
and the lower of the two the dealer; if,
however, the fourth card be the lowest, the two
highest on the re-cut are partners and the original
lowest the dealer.</p>

<p>21. Six players constitute a full table, and
no player shall have a right to cut into a game
which is complete.</p>

<p>22. When there are more than six candidates,
the right to succeed any player who may retire
is acquired by announcing the desire to do so,
and such announcement shall constitute a prior
right to the first vacancy.</p>

<p class="redhead">CUTTING OUT</p>

<p>23. If at the end of a rubber, should admission
be claimed by one or two candidates, the
player or players having played a greater number
of consecutive rubbers shall withdraw; but
when all have played the same number, they<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a>
must cut to decide upon the outgoers; the highest
are out.</p>

<p class="redhead">RIGHTS OF ENTRY</p>

<p>24. A candidate desiring to enter a table
must declare such wish before any player at
the table cuts a card, either for the purpose of
beginning a new rubber or of cutting out.</p>

<p>25. In the formation of new tables, those
candidates who have neither belonged to nor
played at any other table have the prior right
of entry. Those who have already played decide
their right of admission by cutting.</p>

<p>26. A player who cuts into one table while
belonging to another, shall forfeit his prior
right of re-entry into the latter, unless by doing
so he enables three candidates to form a fresh
table. In this event he may signify his intention
of returning to his original table, and his
place at the new one can be filled.</p>

<p>27. Should any player quit the table during
the progress of a rubber, he may, with the consent
of the other three players, appoint a substitute
during his absence; but such appointment
shall become void with the conclusion of
the rubber, and shall not in any way affect the
substitute's rights.<a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a></p>

<p>28. If anyone break up a table, the remaining
players have a prior right to play at other
tables.</p>

<p class="redhead">SHUFFLING</p>

<p>29. The pack must neither be shuffled below
the table nor so the face of any card be seen.</p>

<p>30. The dealer's partner must collect the
cards for the ensuing deal and he has the first
right to shuffle the cards. Each player has the
right to shuffle subsequently. The dealer has
the right to shuffle last, but should a card or
cards be seen during his shuffling, or whilst giving
the pack to be cut, he must re-shuffle.</p>

<p>31. Each player, after shuffling, must place
the cards properly collected and face downward
to the left of the player next to deal.</p>

<p class="redhead">THE DEAL</p>

<p>32. Each player deals in his turn; the order
of dealing goes to the left.</p>

<p>33. The player on the dealer's right cuts the
pack, and in dividing it he must not leave fewer
than four cards in either packet; if in cutting
or in replacing one of the two packets a card
be exposed, or if there be any confusion of the<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a>
cards or a doubt as to the exact place in which
the pack was divided, there must be a fresh cut.</p>

<p>34. When the player whose duty it is to cut
has once separated the pack he can neither re-shuffle
nor re-cut the cards.</p>

<p>35. Should the dealer shuffle the cards, after
the pack is cut, the pack must be cut again.</p>

<p>36. The fifty-two cards shall be dealt face
downward. The deal is not completed until
the last card has been dealt face downward.</p>

<p>37. <span class="smcap">There is No Misdeal.</span></p>

<p class="redhead">A NEW DEAL</p>

<p>38. There must be a new deal&mdash;</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>a</i> If the cards be not dealt into four packets, one at a
time, and in regular rotation, beginning at the
dealer's left.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>b</i> If, during a deal, or during the play of a hand, the
pack be proven incorrect or imperfect.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>c</i> If any card be faced in the pack.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>d</i> If any player have dealt to him a greater number of
cards than thirteen.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>e</i> If the dealer deal two cards at once and then deal a
third before correcting the error.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>f</i> If the dealer omit to have the pack cut and the adversaries
call attention to the fact prior to the conclusion
of the deal and before looking at their cards.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>g</i> If the last card do not come in its regular order to
the dealer.
<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a></p>

<p>39. There may be a new deal&mdash;</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>a</i> If the dealer or his partner expose a card. The
eldest hand may claim a new deal.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>b</i> If either adversary expose a card. The dealer or
his partner may claim a new deal.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>c</i> If, before fifty-one cards are dealt, the dealer should
look at any card. His adversaries have the right to
see it, and the eldest hand may exact a new deal.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>d</i> If, in dealing, one of the last cards be exposed by
the dealer or his partner, and the deal is completed
before there is reasonable time for the eldest hand
to decide as to a new deal. But in all other cases
such penalties must be claimed prior to the completion
of the deal.</p>

<p>40. The claim for a new deal by reason of a
card exposed during the deal may not be made
by a player who has looked at any of his cards.
If a new deal does not take place, the card exposed
during the deal cannot be called.</p>

<p>41. Should three players have their right
number of cards, and should the fourth, not
being dummy, have less than thirteen and not
discover such deficiency until he has played any
of his cards, the deal stands good; should he
have played, he is answerable for any revoke
he may have made as if the missing card or
cards had been in his hand. The other pack
may be searched for the missing card or cards.<a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a></p>

<p>42. If during the play of a deal a pack be
proven incorrect or imperfect, such proof renders
only the current deal void, and does not
affect any prior score. The dealer must deal
again (Law 38, <i>b</i>).</p>

<p>43. Anyone dealing with the adversaries'
cards must be corrected before the play of the
first card, otherwise the deal stands good. If
anyone deals when it is the turn of an adversary,
such error must be corrected before the
cards are dealt for the following deal.</p>

<p>44. A player can neither shuffle, cut nor deal
for his partner without the permission of his
adversaries.</p>

<p class="redhead">DECLARING TRUMPS</p>

<p>45. The trump is declared. No card is
turned.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>a</i> The dealer may either make the trump or pass the
declaration to his partner.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>b</i> If the declaration be passed to partner, he must
make the trump.</p>

<p>46. Should the dealer's partner make the
trump without receiving permission from the
dealer, the eldest hand may demand,</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">1st. That the trump shall stand, or</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">2d. That there shall be a new deal.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a></p>

<p>But if any declaration as to doubling, or not
doubling, shall have been made, or if a new
deal be not claimed, the declaration wrongly
made shall stand. The eldest hand is the
player on the left of the dealer.</p>

<p>47. Should the dealer's partner pass the declaration
to the dealer it shall be the right of the
eldest hand to claim a new deal or to compel
the offending player to declare the trump; provided,
that no declaration as to doubling has
been made.</p>

<p>48. If either of the dealer's adversaries make
or pass the declaration, the dealer may, after
looking at his hand, either claim a new deal or
proceed as if no declaration had been made.</p>

<p>49. A declaration once made cannot be altered.</p>

<p class="redhead">DOUBLING, RE-DOUBLING, ETC.</p>

<p>50. The effect of doubling, re-doubling, and
so on, is that the value of each trick above six
is doubled, quadrupled, and so on.</p>

<p>51. After the trump declaration has been
made by the dealer or his partner, their adversaries
have the right to double. The eldest
hand has the first right. If he does not<a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a>
wish to double, he may ask his partner, "May
I lead?" His partner shall answer, "Yes" or
"I double."</p>

<p>52. If either of their adversaries elect to
double, the dealer and his partner have the right
to re-double. The player who has declared the
trump shall have the first right. He may say,
"I re-double" or "Satisfied." Should he say
the latter, his partner may re-double.</p>

<p>53. If the dealer or his partner elect to re-double,
their adversaries shall have the right to
again double. The original doubler has the
first right.</p>

<p>54. If the right-hand adversary of the dealer
double before his partner has asked "May I
lead?" the declarer of the trump shall have the
right to say whether or not the double shall
stand. If he decide that the double shall stand,
the process of re-doubling may continue as described
in paragraphs 52, 53, 55.</p>

<p>55. The process of re-doubling may be continued
indefinitely.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> The first right to continue
the re-doubling on behalf of a partnership
belongs to that player who has last redoubled.<a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a>
Should he, however, express himself
satisfied, the right to continue the re-doubling
passes to his partner. Should any player re-double
out of turn, the adversary who last
doubled shall decide whether or not such double
shall stand. If it is decided that the re-double
shall stand, the process of re-doubling may continue
as described in this and foregoing laws
(52 and 53). If any double or re-double out of
turn be not accepted there shall be no further
doubling in that hand. Any consultation between
partners as to doubling or re-doubling
will entitle the maker of the trump or the eldest
hand, without consultation, to a new deal.</p>

<p>56. If the eldest hand lead before the doubling
be completed, his partner may re-double
only with the consent of the adversary who last
doubled; but such lead shall not affect the right
of either adversary to double.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> In some clubs, doubling ceases whenever the value of the
odd trick exceeds one hundred points; in other clubs the limit is
placed at two hundred points.</p></div>

<p>57. When the question, "May I lead?" has
been answered in the affirmative or when the
player who has the last right to continue the
doubling, expresses himself satisfied, the play
shall begin.</p>

<p>58. Should the eldest hand lead without asking
permission, his partner may double, but
only if the maker of the trump consent.<a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a></p>

<p>59. Should the right-hand adversary of the
dealer ask permission to lead, the eldest hand
does not thereby lose his right to double.
Should the right-hand adversary of the dealer
double before his partner has asked "May I
lead?" the maker of the trump shall have the
right to say whether or not the double shall
stand. If he decide that the double shall stand,
the process of re-doubling may continue as described
in Laws 52, 53, 55.</p>

<p>60. If the right-hand adversary of the dealer
lead out of turn, the maker of the trump may
call a suit from the eldest hand, who may only
double if the maker of the trump consent.</p>

<p>A declaration as to doubling or re-doubling
once made cannot be altered.</p>

<p class="redhead">DUMMY</p>

<p>61. As soon as the eldest had has led, the
dealer's partner shall place his cards face upward
on the table, and the duty of playing the
cards from that hand shall devolve upon the
dealer, unassisted by his partner.</p>

<p>62. Before exposing his cards, the dealer's
partner has all the rights of a player, but after
his cards have been shown the dealer's partner<a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a>
takes no part whatever in the play, except that
he has the right&mdash;</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>a</i> To ask the dealer whether he has none of the suit
in which he may have renounced.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>b</i> To ask the dealer when called upon to play his highest
or lowest card whether he has conformed to the
penalty.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>c</i> To call the dealer's attention to the fact that a trick
has not been completed.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>d</i> To correct the claim of either adversary to a penalty
to which the latter is not entitled.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>e</i> To call attention to the fact that a trick has been
erroneously taken by either side.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>f</i> To participate in the discussion of any disputed question
of fact which may arise between the dealer
and either adversary.</p>

<p class="nwdl"><i>g</i> To correct an erroneous score.</p>

<p>63. Should the dealer's partner call attention
to any other incident of the play, in consequence
of which any penalty might be exacted, the fact
of his so doing precludes the dealer exacting
such penalty.</p>

<p>64. If the dealer's partner, by touching a
card or otherwise, suggest the play of a card
from dummy, either of the adversaries may, but
without consultation, call upon the dealer to
play or not to play the card suggested.</p>

<p>65. Dummy is not liable to the penalty for
a revoke; and if he should revoke and the error<a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a>
be not discovered until the trick is turned and
quitted, the trick stands good.</p>

<p>66. A card from the dealer's hand is not
played until actually quitted; but should the
dealer name or touch a card from the dummy
hand, such card is considered as played, unless
the dealer in touching the card or cards says,
"I arrange," or words to that effect.</p>

<p class="redhead">CARDS EXPOSED BEFORE PLAY</p>

<p>67. If, after the deal has been completed and
before the trump declaration has been made,
either the dealer or his partner expose a card
from his hand, the eldest hand may, without
consulting with his partner, claim a new deal.</p>

<p>68. If, after the deal has been completed and
before a card is led, any player shall expose a
card, his partner shall forfeit any right to
double or re-double which he otherwise would
have been entitled to exercise; and in case of
a card being so exposed by the leader's partner,
the dealer may either call the card or require
the leader not to lead the suit of the exposed
card.<a name="page_117" id="page_117"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">CARDS EXPOSED DURING PLAY</p>

<p>69. All cards exposed by the dealer's adversaries
are liable to be called, and such cards
must be left face upward on the table.</p>

<p>70. The following are exposed cards:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary=""
style="margin-left:3%;">
<tr valign="top"><td>1st.</td><td>Two or more cards played at once.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td>2d.</td><td>Any card dropped with its face upward, or in any
way exposed on or above the table, even though
snatched up so quickly that no one can name it.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td>3d.</td><td>Every card so held by a player that his partner
can see any portion of its face.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>71. A card dropped on the floor or elsewhere
below the table is not an exposed card.</p>

<p>72. If two or more cards be played at once,
by either of the dealer's adversaries, the dealer
shall have the right to call which one be pleases
to the current trick, and the other card or cards
shall remain face upward on the table and may
be called at any time.</p>

<p>73. If, without waiting for his partner to
play, either of the dealer's adversaries should
play on the table the best card or lead one which
is a winning card, as against the dealer and
dummy, or should continue (without waiting
for his partner to play) to lead several such
cards, the dealer may demand that the partner<a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a>
of the player in fault, win, if he can, the first,
or any other of these tricks, and the other cards
thus improperly played are exposed cards.</p>

<p>74. If either or both of the dealer's adversaries
throw his or their cards on the table face
upward, such cards are exposed and are liable
to be called; but if either adversary retain his
hand he cannot be forced to abandon it. If,
however, the dealer should say, "I have the
rest," or any other words indicating that the
remaining tricks are his, the adversaries of the
dealer are not liable to have any of their cards
called should they expose them, believing the
dealer's claim to be true, should it subsequently
prove false.</p>

<p>75. If a player who has rendered himself
liable to have the highest or lowest of a suit
called (Laws 82, 91, 92 and 100), fail to play
as directed, or if, when called on to lead one
suit, lead another, having in his hand one or
more cards of the suit demanded (Law 76), or
if called upon to win or lose a trick, fail to do
so when he can (Laws 73, 82 and 100), he is
liable to the penalty for revoke, unless such
play be corrected before the trick is turned and
quitted.<a name="page_119" id="page_119"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">LEADS OUT OF TURN</p>

<p>76. If either of the dealer's adversaries lead
out of turn, the dealer may call the card erroneously
led, or may call a suit when it is the
turn of either adversary to lead.</p>

<p>77. If the dealer lead out of turn, either from
his own hand or dummy, he incurs no penalty;
but he may not rectify the error after the second
hand has played.</p>

<p>78. If any player lead out of turn and the
other three follow him, the trick is complete
and the error cannot be rectified; but if only
the second, or second and third play to the false
lead, their cards may be taken back; there is
no penalty against anyone except the original
offender, who, if he be one of the dealer's adversaries,
may be penalised as provided in Laws
60 and 76.</p>

<p>79. In no case can a player he compelled to
play a card which would oblige him to revoke.</p>

<p>80. The call of an exposed card may be repeated
at every trick until such card has been
played.</p>

<p>81. If a player called on to lead a suit have
none of it, the penalty is paid.<a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a></p>

<p class="redhead">CARDS PLAYED IN ERROR</p>

<p>82. Should the third hand not have played
and the fourth play before his partner, the latter
(not being dummy or dealer) may be called
upon to play his highest or lowest card of the
suit played, or to win or lose the trick.</p>

<p>83. If anyone, not being dummy, omit playing
to a former trick and such error be not corrected
until he has played to the next, the adversaries
may claim a new deal; should they
decide that the deal stands good, the surplus
card at the end of the hand is considered to
have been played to the imperfect trick, but
does not constitute a revoke therein.</p>

<p>84. If anyone (except dummy) play two
cards to the same trick, or mix a card with a
trick to which it does not belong, and the mistake
be not discovered until the hand is played
out, he is answerable for any consequent revokes
he may have made. If during the play
of the hand the error be detected, the tricks may
be counted face downward, in order to ascertain
whether there be among them a card too many;
should this be the case, the trick which contains
a surplus card may be examined and the card
restored to its original holder, who (not being<a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a>
dummy) shall be liable for any revoke he may
meanwhile have made.</p>

<p class="redhead">THE REVOKE</p>

<p>85. A revoke occurs when a player (other
than dummy), holding one or more cards of the
suit led, plays a card of a different suit. The
penalty for a revoke takes precedence of all
other counts.</p>

<p>86. A revoke is established if the trick in
which it occurs be turned and quitted, <i>i.e.</i>, the
hand removed from the trick after it has been
gathered and placed face downward on the
table; or if either the revoking player or his
partner, whether in his right turn or otherwise,
have led or played to the following trick.</p>

<p>87. The penalty for a revoke is three tricks
taken from the revoking player and added to
those of the adversaries.</p>

<p>88. The penalty is applicable only to the
score of the game in which it occurs.</p>

<p>89. Under no circumstances can the revoking
side score game in that hand. Whatever
their previous score may have been, the side revoking
cannot attain a higher score toward game
than twenty-eight.</p>

<p>90. A player may ask his partner whether<a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a>
he has not a card of the suit which he has renounced;
should the question be asked before
the trick is turned and quitted, subsequent turning
and quitting does not establish a revoke, and
the error may be corrected unless the question
be answered in the negative or unless the revoking
player or his partner has led or played
to the following trick.</p>

<p>91. If a player correct his mistake in time
to save a revoke, any player or players who have
followed him may withdraw their cards and
substitute others, and the cards so withdrawn
are not exposed cards. If the player in fault
be one of the dealer's adversaries, the card
played in error is an exposed card, and the
dealer can call it whenever he pleases; or he
may require the offender to play his highest
or lowest card or the suit to the trick in which
he has renounced.</p>

<p>92. If the player in fault be the dealer, the
eldest hand may require him to play the highest
or lowest card of the suit in which he has
renounced, provided both adversaries of the
dealer have played to the current trick; but this
penalty cannot be exacted against the dealer
when he is fourth in hand, nor can it be enforced
at all from dummy.<a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a></p>

<p>93. At the end of a hand the claimants of
a revoke may search all the tricks. If the cards
have been mixed the claim may be urged and
proved if possible; but no proof is necessary,
and the revoke is established if, after it has
been claimed, the accused player or his partner
mix the cards before they have been sufficiently
examined by the adversaries.</p>

<p>94. A revoke must be claimed before the
cards have been cut for the following deal.</p>

<p>95. Should the players on both sides subject
themselves to the revoke penalty neither can win
the game by that hand.</p>

<p>96. The revoke penalty may be claimed for
as many revokes as occur during a hand; but
the accumulated penalty shall in no event exceed
thirteen tricks. (See Law 7.)</p>

<p class="redhead">GENERAL RULES</p>

<p>97. There should not be any consultation
between partners as to the enforcement of penalties.
If they do so consult, the penalty is
paid.</p>

<p>98. Once a trick is complete, turned and
quitted it must not be looked at (except under
Law 84), until the end of the hand.<a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a></p>

<p>99. Any player during the play of a trick
or after the four cards are played and before
they are touched for the purpose of gathering
them together, may demand that the cards be
placed before their respective players.</p>

<p>100. If either of the dealer's adversaries,
prior to his partner's playing, should call attention
to the trick, either by saying it is his, or,
without being requested so to do, by naming his
card or drawing it toward him, the dealer may
require that opponent's partner to play his
highest or lowest card of the suit led, or to
win or lose the trick.</p>

<p>101. Either of the dealer's adversaries may
call his partner's attention to the fact that he is
about to lead out of turn, but if he make any
unauthorised reference to any incident of the
play the dealer may call a suit from the adversary
whose turn it is next to lead.</p>

<p>102. In all cases where a penalty has been
incurred, the offender is bound to give reasonable
time for the decision of his adversaries;
but if a wrong penalty be demanded none can
be enforced.</p>

<p>103. The partner of the eldest hand may inform
him that their adversaries have incurred
a penalty, but may not give any further information.<a name="page_125" id="page_125"></a>
Should he suggest the penalty, or demand
the enforcement of it, such action shall
be deemed a consultation, and no penalty can
be enforced.</p>

<p class="redhead">NEW CARDS</p>

<p>104. Unless a pack be imperfect, no player
shall have the right to call for one new pack.
If fresh cards are demanded, two packs must
be furnished and paid for by the player who
has demanded them. If they are furnished
during a rubber, the adversaries shall have their
choice of new cards. If it is the beginning of
a new rubber, the dealer, whether he or one of
his adversaries be the party calling for the new
cards, shall have the choice. New cards must
be called for before the pack is cut for a new
deal.</p>

<p>105. A card or cards torn or marked must
be replaced by agreement or new cards furnished.</p>

<p class="redhead">BYSTANDERS</p>

<p>106. While a bystander, by agreement among
the players, may decide any question, yet he
must on no account say anything unless appealed
to; and if he make any remark which<a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a>
calls attention to an oversight affecting the
score, or to the exaction of a penalty, he is liable
to be called on by the players to pay the stakes
on that rubber.</p>

<p class="cb"><big>SPADE CONVENTION</big></p>

<p>I.&mdash;Where players agree "not to play spades"
the rule is, that if the spade make is not doubled,
the hand shall be played where either side
is 20 or over.</p>

<p>II.&mdash;If the third hand player ask, "Shall I
play?" or should he lead out of turn, or should
the eldest hand lead without asking permission
to play, the spade maker may take two on the
score or may call a lead and require the hand
to be played out.</p>

<p>III.&mdash;Should the third hand player double
before his partner asks permission to play, the
spade maker may decide whether the double
shall stand or not; but the hand must be played
out.<a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a></p>

<p class="cb"><big>ETIQUETTE</big></p>

<p>It has been truthfully said that there is no
game in which slight intimations can convey
so much information as that of Bridge. In justice
to those who, by their manner, give information,
it may be stated that most of the
apparent unfairness at the Bridge table is unintentional.
Hesitation and mannerisms, however,
cannot be too carefully avoided; such a
breach of etiquette is an offence for which the
adversaries have no redress except perhaps a
refusal to continue the play.</p>

<p>It is obviously a greater fault to take advantage
of information thus given. A play in
your judgment may be perfectly sound, but you
leave yourself open to criticism if it is in any
way contingent on information obtained from
your partner's manner.</p>

<p>Cultivate uniformity in your style of play;
let there be no remarkable haste or hesitation
in making or passing; try always to use the
same formula of words, and do not call attention
to the score after the cards have been dealt.</p>

<p>Remember that any undue hesitancy in regard<a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a>
to doubling will deprive a fair-minded
partner of the privilege of so doing. Such delays
are too frequent at spade declarations.</p>

<p>Emphasise no play of your own and show no
pleasure or displeasure at any other play.</p>

<p>Do not ask to have the cards placed unless it
is solely for your own information.</p>

<p>It is an offence either to revoke purposely or
to make a second revoke in order to conceal the
first.</p>

<p>The dealer's partner should not call attention
to the score nor to any card or cards that he
or the other players hold, and neither should
he leave his seat for the purpose of watching
his partner's play.</p>

<p>When there is an unusual distribution of the
cards, no remarks of any kind should be allowed.</p>

<p>After a hand has been played, it may be discussed
to the common benefit; but the bore who
is continually blowing up his partner to show
his superior knowledge, together with the player
who interrupts the game to discuss the play,
should be ostracised from the card-room. Superiority
of skill is shown by the play of the
cards, not by mannerisms.</p>

<p>It is often difficult to refrain from showing
<i>pleasure</i> at the accomplishment of a desired purpose,<a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a>
but undue elation is most aggravating to
the adversaries.</p>

<p>Do not make a dig at the adversaries by confiding
to your partner that your success was due
to an ill-judged play of the opponent.</p>

<p>It is not good form to complain of poor cards,
as you imply that the adversaries profit by your
weak hands and not by their skill.</p>

<p>The better players rarely criticise unless
asked to do so; it is usually the inexperienced
player who offers an astonishing amount of
gratuitous and unsought-for advice.</p>

<p>Do not tell your partner, after seeing all the
cards, what he should have done, but think what
you would have done in your partner's place.
Do not criticise at all, but if you must, criticise
fairly.<a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a></p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
